                    <p class="card-text">Games in the Mario series are constantly redefining their own standards, 
					and often influencing the games that follow as a result. Super Mario Bros. 
					defined the 2D platforming genre in the mid-80's. Super Mario World showed the 
					abilities of the Super Nintendo with scaling and rotation of sprites, 
					and gameplay mechanics that rewarded 100 percent completion of levels</p>
                    <p>Mario is named after Mario Segale, the landlord of one of Nintendo of America's
					original warehouses who was lenient with Minoru Arakawa while Nintendo was still 
					finding its feet in America.</p>
					<p>Originally a carpenter named Jumpman, this Italian plumber has gone on to become 
					the most recognizable video game character of them all, starring in a veritable 
					pantheon of titles like kart racing and sports. He has been voiced by Charles 
					Martinet for nearly 20 years.</p>
